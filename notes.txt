Current changes:
- changed renaming pattern
    - cutting out 'WE'

- made test.pln more complex
    - 2 seperate appartments

- cleared out old ifc object ('ifc rest-trash')
    - only outputs current names of ifc objects when using ifcopenshell


Next up:
- work on seperating doors per story
    - look out where the first IfcSpace starts (from bottom -> up)
        - maybe use (0, 0, 0) coordinates (origin) as a reference
